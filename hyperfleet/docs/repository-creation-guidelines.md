# HyperFleet Repository Creation Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the mandatory configuration steps and conventions for creating new repositories within the HyperFleet organization. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, security, and proper collaboration across all HyperFleet repositories.

**Key Areas Covered:**
1. Repository Naming and Initialization
2. Branch Protection Configuration
3. Team Access Configuration

**Purpose**: Standardized conventions for creating and configuring new repositories in the HyperFleet project.
**Note**: This document provides the MVP baseline. More conventions will be introduced and refined after the MVP phase.

## Repository Naming and Initialization
- Repository name contains relevant keywords for discoverability, use lowercase with hyphens to separate words (kebab-case)
- Repository description is accurate and meaningful
- Choose visibility: **public**
- Repository is initialized with README.md during creation
- Repository is initialized with appropriate LICENSE (**Apache-2.0 license**) during creation

    - Required approvals: 1

## CICD Jobs for Repository
- If a presubmit job or image build job is required, please create the corresponding JIRA tickets to request the setup.
- For reference, you may refer to similar tickets such as HYPERFLEET-135, HYPERFLEET-134.
- To configure your repository for testing and merge automation (Prow, OpenShift CI, robot access), follow the [Onboarding a New Component for Testing and Merge Automation](release/test-release/onboarding-a-new-component-for-testing-and-merge-automation.md) guide.
