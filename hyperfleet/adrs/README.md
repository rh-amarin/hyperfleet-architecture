# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for HyperFleet. Each ADR captures a significant decision, why it was made, and what was rejected.

---

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when a decision:

- Affects multiple components or teams
- Is hard to reverse
- Has meaningful trade-offs between alternatives
- Would leave future contributors wondering "why did they do it this way?"

Do **not** write an ADR for implementation details, config changes, or decisions that are obvious from the code.

---

## Naming Convention

```
NNNN-short-title.md
```

Examples: `0001-use-cloudevents-for-adapter-pulses.md`, `0002-sentinel-pull-model.md`

Numbers are sequential. Use the next available number.

## Template
